  <p>For the period of time in which it aired, John Berger's "Ways of Seeing" introduces 
    progressive ideas of how art can be seen and analyzed. Berger touches upon ideas of 
    consumerism, sexism, and racism. In the first episode, he sets a foundation for the show
    to invite viewers to be skeptical about everything he has to say in these series. Berger explains
    that a painting can be perceived very differently based on the context, sound, and environment
    surrounding it. He also speaks about how in film, details are selected in time to make a narrative.
    Therefore, the filmmaker has the power to control what the audience sees and thinks. However, 
    paintings are unique as it exists simultaneously. As a viewer enters the room, the whole painting is 
    in front of them. This made me curious about which part of the painting I tend to look at first. As 
    Berger set this tone, I found that he built an intimate level of trust with the viewer. He put 
    himself in a vulnerable position to be critiqued and criticized.  
  </p>

  <p>In episode 2, Berger reflects on how European nudes and the predominantly female models are a reflection
    of a patriarchal society. What stood out to me the most was Berger's point that these European nudes
    were made for the male gaze. They were painted for the pleasure and enjoyment of men and this can be seen 
    in the way the women pose to face the viewer and the nature in which they were painted. These models were
    often painted laying around with minimum energy spent. Berger was also honest in that he was in no position
    to speak on how this affected women and their image of themselves. In an interview with five white women,
    they all expressed that they did not see themselves in the women portrayed in European nudes. One woman
    explained that a true representation of a woman would be a woman representing peace and not playing a role. 
    I found this to be very insightful but I would be very interested in the perspective of women of colors who 
    are very rarely represented in "fine" arts. Additionally, I would propose that European nudes also represent 
    colorism in society as almost all of the models are portrayed with fair skin.
  </p>

  <p>Ah yes, CONSUMERISM! In episode 3, Berger talks about the value of paintings and how art celebrates wealth
    and power. For one, paintings were often bought by the wealthy who could afford to. Additionally, portraits
    were often commissioned by the wealthy and Berger explains that this showed a continuity of power and wealth.
    I related this a lot to the idea of generational wealth, assets being passed down from one generation to the
    next and how this can also affect race. This can also be connected to our discussion in class about
    racial injustice as there is still a large gap today. Summarized in very few words, Black Americans have
    accumulated far less wealth than white Americans because they were only able to own property and build
    capital recently in history. This can be explained in a short peisode from "Explained" from Netflix:

  <p> Ah yes, MORE CONSUMERISM! In this final episode, Berger delves into publicity, glamour, and how public imagery 
    can persuade us to buy things to making ourselves feel more adequate. One striking thing about this episode was when
    Berger explained that color photography and oil painting are similar in the way that they both try to show 
    texture and tangibility. Publicity and public imagery, like advertisements in magazines, make us believe that
    by spending more to buy material things we are becoming more. They also make us believe that we want a different life,
    most likely a life of luxury, and how buying more things can get us this life. Another really striking thing was
    the flipping of the magazine to show the stark difference between the advertising for luxury goods with photos 
    of refugees. I found this to be powerful as it shows how privileged people are caught up in a world of material
    while others barely have the necessities to live a good qualify of life.
